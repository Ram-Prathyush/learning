distbrutive property:
it is just like multlyplying
example:3(a+b)=3a+3b

PEMDAS order of algebra

full form
P --> PARENTSESS or BRACKETS e.x {} [] () ||
E -->EXPONENTS e.x 2 TO THE POWER OF 2 etc
M --> MULTIPLICATION e.x 2 x 3
D --> DIVISION e.x 3/2
A --> ADDTION e.x 2+3
S --> SUBSTRACTION e.x 7-3 =

evalvauting expressions
if : x=-1 y=3 m=4 n=2
x-y(m+n)
-4(6)
ans -24

22/7/23
--------
inverse opreation
6-4= 2
4+2=6
ithe inverse opration of substraction is addtion and inverse opration of addtion is substraction
5x4=20
20/4=5
the inverse opration of multlication is division and the inverse opration of division is multiplication
23/7/23
simple equations
x + 7 = 234
what is the value of x
to make 7 away from x we need to substract 7 from 7 so it is 0
snd substract 7  from right hand side
so x=227
25/7/23
balancing equations 
if x + 5 = 2
if we substract like this
x + 5 = 2
   -5
__________
x = 2 is wrong
if we do like this
x + 5 = 2
___-5__-5______
x = -3 that is correct

8/7/23
subscripts

subscripts are like 
y  k
 p  k
 they can be more useful to repesrent the things
 
6/8/23
polynomils
is like multiple terms
   2    3     4   3
(2x + 4x )+(8x -7x )
to remove from the brackets add 1 like below
    2    3      4   3
1(2x + 4x )+1(8x -7x )
 then it will be removed
 and after removing it will be like this
   2     3   4   3
 2x  + 4x +8x -7x
 after that you can add and substract like normal algebra

 zero threom
 if a.b=0
 any a  or b must be zero 
 that is the most simplist zero therom
